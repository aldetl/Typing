; Please use the key names defined in 'keys.txt', or you can check a key's name by pressing it on the main window.
;   Modifier keys can be: CapsLock, Control, Alt, Shift, LControlKey, RControlKey, LShiftKey, RShiftKey, LMenu, RMenu
;   If you need CapsLock or Alt(LMenu,RMenu) as a modifier key for hotkeys, you'd better add it to be a mode-key,

; Format for the configuration: 
;   left side is the key you need to press = right side is the command, or keys you need to send;
;   If the name on the right side starts with capital letter, then it represents a key;
;   Keys defined in [modekeys] section are only valid in command-mode; 
;   Keys defined in [hotkeys] section are valid any time when Typing is enabled;
;   For a combined key, the modifier keys need to be put in front of other keys;
;   Use different keycode for the same modifier keys if they appear at both sides, e.g., LShiftKey+L=RShiftKey+Left.
