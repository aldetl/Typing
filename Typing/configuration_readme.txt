; Comment row starts with ';'
; Please use the key names defined in 'keys.txt';
; Names for the modifier keys are: CapsLock, LControlKey, RControlKey, LShiftKey, RShiftKey, LMenu, RMenu
;   If you need CapsLock or Alt(LMenu,RMenu) as a modifier key for hotkeys, you'd better also add it to be a mode-key,
; Format for the configuration: left side is the key you will press = right side is the command;
;   If the name on the right side starts with capital letter, then it represents a key;
;   Keys defined in [modekeys] section are valid in command-mode; 
;   Keys defined in [hotkeys] section are valid any time when Typing is enabled;
;   The modifier keys need to be put ahead of other keys;
;   Use different keycode for the same modifier keys if they appear at both sides, e.g., LShiftKey+L=RShiftKey+Left.
